# Time-series-forecasting-using-ARIMA

Time-series forecasting is a component of machine learning which is often given less weightage owing to its complexity. Temporal component of the time-series often discourages machine learning practitoners from utilizing this. But its impact can be wide-reaching. The most important utilization of this has been done in weather forecasting, stock market prices prediction, etc.

In this notebook, I am going to be as elaborate as possible while discussing how you can make time-series forecasting using ARIMA/SARIMA.
